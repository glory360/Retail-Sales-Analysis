### Introduction
The retail sector continually evolves, influenced by various factors such as consumer behavior, economic conditions, and socio-demographic changes. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of retail sales by examining total profit across different product categories, gender demographics, age ranges, and monthly patterns. By identifying trends and patterns, this analysis will provide actionable insights that can inform inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business decisions.

### Project Overview 
This retail sales analysis project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how different factors influence total profits in the retail sector. By leveraging data analytics, the project will deliver actionable insights that can enhance both strategic decision-making and customer engagement, ultimately driving business growth

### Data Source
The primary data source for this project is an extensive dataset containing information on Retail Sales from the retail database, ensuring it includes product categories, gender and age of customers, and monthly sales figures. It can be downloaded here.

### Tools and Techniques 
For this analysis, I utilised Excel (Power query Editor) for cleaning and enriching the data, and pivot tables to get the insights along side with pivot charts to visualize.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - Clean the dataset to remove inconsistencies or duplicates.
   - Classify customers into defined age ranges

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
1. To analyze total profit generated from various product categories, identifying which categories are most profitable.
2. To evaluate the distribution of total profit across different gender demographics, understanding how purchasing behavior varies between male and female customers.
3. To segment total profit data by different age ranges, identifying which age groups contribute most to overall sales.
4. To examine monthly trends in total profit, highlighting seasonal variations and identifying peak sales periods.
5. To provide a visual representation of customer distribution by gender and its correlation with total profit.
